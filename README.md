# Handong Bio-AI Workshop Winter 2023

## Competition

Unfortunatelly, no time to set up a Kaggle competition, so this time we will do it manually.

The baseline code will be provided as `detect_pneumonia_cxr_baseline.ipynb`

Rename the file to `detect_pneumonia_cxr_###.ipynb` where `###` is your student ID.

Open `detect_pneumonia_cxr_###.ipynb` into your Google Colab environment, update the code and see if you can improve the test accuracy.

Make sure you convert `*.ipynb` into `*.pdf` and submit both files.

You must include

### Submission File

Zip the following files into `###.zip` where `###` is your student ID.

- `detect_pneumonia_cxr_###.ipynb`
- `detect_pneumonia_cxr_###.pdf`
- `model_state_dict.pth`
- `model_scripted.pt`
